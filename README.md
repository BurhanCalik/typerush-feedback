## 📂 About This Repository

You might notice this repository doesn't contain the source code.

Since TypeRush features a **Ranked System** and **Global Leaderboards**, the core codebase remains closed-source to prevent the creation of bots or cheats. This ensures the rankings remain fair for everyone.

However, community feedback is vital! This space is for **YOU** to help shape the future of TypeRush.
